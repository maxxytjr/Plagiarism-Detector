# Plagiarism-Detector

## Introduction
A Plagiarism Detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling a file as plagiarized or not; depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. 

This is part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.

## Description
Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research, and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are not so obvious.

## Feature Engineering
One of the ways to detect plagiarism is by computing **similarity features** that measure how similar a text is compared to the source text.
